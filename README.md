## Case

I've used carbonfet's project (https://github.com/carbonfet/dactyl-manuform). It uses clojure to generate .scad files that can be opened with OpenSCAD and exported to .stl. While Pyhton project (https://github.com/joshreve/dactyl-keyboard) looks promising, at the time it looked a bit inmature. 

I went with 4x6 design - diff can be found [here](https://github.com/TomazKarer/dactyl_buildlog/blob/main/case.diff).
